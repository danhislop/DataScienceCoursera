# -CourseraClasses (2019)
This represents some of the work done while completing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate

This work was completed before Georgia Tech's MS Analytics coursework - most of which due to student honor codes is not posted publicly. One project Random Variates Generator is available [here](https://github.com/danhislop/Projects/blob/master/RVDistributions/README.md)


If the Jupyter Notebooks don't render directly from github (sometimes they don't), 
just paste the URL from github directly into: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

for example: 
https://nbviewer.org/github/danhislop/DataScienceCourses/blob/master/ML-Classification_with_python.ipynb
